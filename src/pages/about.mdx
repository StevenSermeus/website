import GithubRepo from "@components/GithubRepo";

I'm a software engineer with a passion for web development. I love to create and build things that are useful and fun. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. I'm currently pursuing a master's degree in software and systems design at Henallux.

## Latest projects I've been working on

<GithubRepo client:load />

## Languages & Tools I use

For my projects, I'm a typesafe enthusiast. I use TypeScript for a lot of my projects. I also use React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS for my frontend projects.

I also built a homelab with a Raspberry Pi 4, 2 pcs, and a Synology NAS. I use it to host my personal projects and services I use daily. Some of the things I leared from that are:

- Docker
- Proxmox VE
- Ansible
- Reverse Proxy with Nginx Reverse Proxy Manager
- Managing Postgres and Redis databases
